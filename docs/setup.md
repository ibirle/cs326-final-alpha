# Setup

Set up is pretty simple for our project, but running it locally will result in limited functionality because credentials are not shared on Github. We have also set it up so it will compile the typescript on heroku when pushed.

1. Pull the repo
2. Run “npm install” to install the dependencies from the package.json
3. Run “npm start” then open localhost:3000 to view the site
